# .NET Examples for the Diffusion and Reappt APIs

This directory contains examples showing the use of the .NET API for Diffusion and Reappt.

These examples are all bundled in a Visual Studio 2013 solution file. Every example is located
in a separate codefile and can be reference/used within the `Program.cs` main method. For the examples to work,
you need to download and reference the ClientInterface assembly. Please download the following files and move 
them into the `dotnet/examples` folder: 

*   PushTechnology.ClientInterface.dll
*   PushTechnology.ClientInterface.XML

No further referencing is required.

    In Diffusion, the client libraries are available in the `clients` directory of the Diffusion server installation.
